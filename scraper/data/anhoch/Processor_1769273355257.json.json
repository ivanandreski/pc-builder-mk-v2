Compared to its predecessor, the assembly of the frame has been significantly simplified by utilising a revised inner contour. For example, there is no longer any need to use a specific torque during Assembly.\n\nThe Contact Frame was designed in collaboration with Roman \"der8auer\" Hartung and is manufactured in Berlin - 100% Made in Germany. Roman Hartung is a mechatronic engineer, hardware enthusiast and content creator in the field of PC hardware. At the same time, he is a well-known overclocker who has designed numerous products for overclocking PC hardware.\n\nLower CPU temperatures\nEasy to assemble\nHigh compatibility\nAnodised aluminium\nThe standard Integrated Loading Mechanism (ILM) has contact points located in the centre of the elongated CPU. Due to the resulting uneven contact pressure of the processor into the socket, the surface of the Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS) curves concavely. As a result, the base plate of the CPU cooler rests primarily on the edges of the IHS, so that the thermal \"hotspot\" in the middle of the CPU is not optimally covered.\n\nThe Intel 13th/14th Gen CPU Contact Frame has a special inner contour to shift the contact pressure from the centre of the CPU to the edges during assembly. This avoids the concave curvature of the IHS. This results in CPU coolers resting better on the processor and a larger contact surface to dissipate the CPU's waste heat.\n\nThe installation of the Contact Frame is very simple and takes only a few steps. Depending on the CPU cooler and the CPU used, the temperatures of the processor can be noticeably reduced.\n\nThe 13th/14th Gen CPU Contact Frame is compatible with 12th, 13th and 14th generation processors for socket LGA1700. In addition, the frame is compatible with CPUs whose Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS) has been ground down by no more than 0.2 millimetres. When mounting, make sure that there are no electronic components under the frame. This is especially important for mainboards with the Mini-ITX form factor.\n\nScope of delivery\n\n1x 13th/14th Gen CPU Contact Frame by der8auer\n4x pan-head screws UNC thread 3/8\"\n1x hexagon socket wrench 5/64\"\n1x angle wrench Torx T20\n\nTechnical Details\nColor: Black\nMaterial: Aluminium\nSocket manufacturer: Intel\nSocket type: 1700\n\nПовеќе информации","price":1190,"availability":true,"imageUrl":"https://www.anhoch.com/storage/media/tgcfi13g_1.jpg","productUrl":"https://www.anhoch.com/products/contact-frame-thermal-grizzly-for-intel-13th--14th-gen-cpu-2020"},{"store":"ANHOCH","category":"Processor","uniqueId":"599882021","name":"Contact Frame Thermal Grizzly for AMD AM5 CPU Socket","description":"PRODUCT INFORMATION \"CONTACT SEALING FRAME - AM5\"\nCombination of contact frame and CPU guard\nThe AM5 Contact & Sealing Frame is a combination of Contact Frame and CPU-Guard for AMD's Ryzen-7000 processors. As a Contact Frame, the AM5 Contact & Sealing Frame creates optimal contact pressure of the CPU into the socket, while an optional, included inlay made of silicone foam serves to protect the exposed components on the CPU.\n\nEncloses the heatspreader\nReplaces the SAM of the mainboard\nMade of anodized aluminium\nOptimized Inner Contour for Even Pressure Distribution\nThe precision-milled inner contour of the AM5 Contact & Sealing Frame creates multiple contact points to the heatspreader compared to the standard SAM. These contact points distribute the contact pressure on the CPU evenly. This ensures that the contact surfaces of the CPU rest uniformly on the pins of the socket. For example, problems with the detection of system memory can be avoided this way.\n\nInnovative Silicone Foam Inlay for Protection and Sealing\nThe AM5 Contact & Sealing Frame comes with a silicone foam inlay. This can be placed on the PCB of the processor, similar to the AMD Ryzen 7000 CPU Guard. When installing the AM5 Contact & Sealing Frame, the gap between the heatspreader and the aluminium frame is sealed by the silicone foam by pressing the foam onto the PCB. This prevents thermal paste or liquid metal from getting onto the CPU's unprotected components. The foam inlay is optional when used with thermal pastes, but mandatory when used with liquid metal.\n\nUser-Friendly Assembly with Clear Marking and Compatibility\nTo simplify installation, there is a corresponding marking on the top of the AM5 Contact & Sealing Frame. Since the socket has a bulge on the upper - the \"northern\" - edge, mounting is only possible in one orientation. Four screws are included for mounting the frame and compatibility with the Thermal Grizzly AM5 backplates is given.\n\nRyzen 8X00G Compatibility\n\nNote: The AM5 Contact & Sealing Frame is compatible with the APUs of the Ryzen 8X00G series. Further information on the compatibility of the AMD Ryzen 5 8500G, AMD Ryzen 5 8600G and AMD Ryzen 7 8700G with our products can be found in the following video: “AMD Ryzen 8000 Delidded - Liquid Metal Changes Everything!”\n\nScope of delivery\n\n1x AM5 Contact & Sealing Frame\n1x Insulator Sheet Red/Black\n4x pan-head screws UNC thread 1/4\"\n1x hexagon socket wrench 5/64\"\n1x angle wrench Torx T20\n\nTechnical Details\nColor: Black\nMaterial: Aluminium\nSocket manufacturer: AMD\nSocket type: AM5\n\nПовеќе информации","price":1190,"availability":true,"imageUrl":"https://www.anhoch.com/storage/media/tgcsfam5_1.jpg","productUrl":"https://www.anhoch.com/products/contact-frame-thermal-grizzly-for-amd-am5-cpu-socket-2021"},{"store":"ANHOCH","category":"Processor","uniqueId":"747066655","name":"Contact Frame Thermal Grizzly for Intel 1851 CPU Socket","description":"Product information \"CPU Contact Frame - Intel 1851\"\nThe Intel 1851 CPU Contact Frame V1 is the version of the well-known mounting aid tailored to Intel motherboards with the LGA1851 socket.\nBy using the Intel 1851 CPU Contact Frame V1, the concave bending of the CPU’s Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS) caused by the standard\nIntegrated Loading Mechanism (ILM) is avoided. This results in better contact between the CPU cooler and the IHS, improving cooling performance.\n\nReduction of CPU temperatures\nEasy to install\nAnodized aluminum\n\nInstalling the contact frame is very simple and requires only a few steps. First, the motherboard's Integrated Loading Mechanism (ILM) must be removed. Depending on the CPU cooler and the CPU used, processor temperatures can be noticeably reduced. When switching from the Reduced-Load ILM (RL-ILM) used on some LGA1851 motherboards, temperature reductions of up to 4°C can be expected, and up to 6°C when switching from the standard ILM.\n\nThe Intel 1851 CPU Contact Frame V1 is compatible with Intel Core Ultra 200 Series processors for the LGA1851 socket. Additionally, the frame is compatible with CPUs whose Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS) has been sanded down by no more than 0.2 millimeters.
